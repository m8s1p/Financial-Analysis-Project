# Financial-Analysis-Project
The aim of the project was to conduct an analysis of a global organisation’s financial position to give the Chief Executive a better understanding of the company’s outgoings.
The organisation had seen a sustained period of growth over the previous 10 years and because of this the greater number of employees had resulted in an increase in salary and bonus payments.
With this in mind, the report focused on these particular outgoings, and as well as informing the Chief Executive of the findings, this project attempted to make some recommendations for improving the financial aspects of the company.
The data cleaning stage of the project was executed in Microsoft Excel and the visualisations were created in Microsoft Power BI. The Salary and Bonus Payment visual was a fully interactive dashboard.
